## Contribution Workflow

### 1. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button on the top right of the [repository page](https://github.com/COSC-Organization/cosc-website.git) to create your own copy.

### 2. Clone Your Fork
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/cosc-website.git
cd cosc-website
```

### 3. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes — never work directly on `main`.
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Use a descriptive branch name, for example:
- `docs/update-readme`
- `fix/navbar-alignment`
- `feature/add-events-page`

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 5. Make Your Changes

Make your changes locally and test them by running the development server:
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
```bash
git commit -m "type: short and clear description of what you changed, added or improved"
```

**Common types:**
| Type | Use when... |
|---|---|
| `feature` | Adding a new feature |
| `fix` | Fixing a bug |
| `docs` | Updating documentation |
| `style` | Formatting changes (no logic change) |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring |

**Examples:**
```
docs: add English contributing guide
fix: correct broken link in footer
feature: add events section to homepage
```

### 7. Push to Your Fork
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### 8. Open a Pull Request

Go to the original repository on GitHub. You will see a **"Compare & pull request"** banner — click it.

In your PR description:
- Reference the issue it closes: `Closes #issue-number`
- Briefly describe what you changed and why
- Keep PRs focused — one change per PR is ideal

## 🔧 Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality. They run automatically when you commit.

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) | Manages Git hooks |
| [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) | Automatic code formatting |
| [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) | Catches code errors and enforces style |

If your commit is blocked, it means Prettier or ESLint found an issue. Fix the reported errors and try committing again.

You can also run them manually:
```bash


# Lint code
pnpm run lint
```
